 Material filling describes additives added to the base material in order to influence the mechanical material characteristics. Most common additives are GF (glass-fiber), GB (glass-balls), MF (mineral-fiber) and T (talcum).
    **Examples:**
    - "Material: PA66-GF30"
      → MATERIAL FILLING: **GF**
    - "Part uses pure PA6 with no fillers."
      → MATERIAL FILLING: **none**
    - "Housing made of PEEK-CF15 (carbon fiber)"
      → MATERIAL FILLING: **CF**
    - "Composite of PA66 with GB and GF additives"
      → MATERIAL FILLING: **(GB+GF)**

    STEP 3: WEIGHT HIERARCHY ANALYSIS
    - Compare numerical weights when present:
      PA66(55%)/PA6(45%) → PA66
    - No weights? Use declaration order:
      \"Primary material: PPS, Secondary: LCP\" → PPS

    STEP 4: SPECIFICITY RESOLUTION
    - Prefer exact grades:
      PA66 > PA6 > PA
      PPSU > PPS

PULL_TO_SEAT_PROMPT = """
Determine Pull-To-Seat requirement using this reasoning chain:

    STEP 1: ACTION IDENTIFICATION
    - Scan for:
      ✓ Explicit \"pull-to-seat\" mentions
      ✓ Terminal insertion process descriptions:
        * \"Pull-back assembly required\"
        * \"Tug-lock mechanism\"
        * \"Retract-to-secure\"
      ✓ Alternative methods:
        * \"Pre-inserted terminals\"
        * \"Tool-free insertion\"
        * \"Push-fit design\"

    STEP 2: OPERATIONAL CONTEXT VALIDATION
    - Confirm mentions relate to PRIMARY ASSEMBLY:
      ✓ Terminal/wire installation
      ✓ Final seating action
      ✗ Maintenance/removal procedures
      ✗ Secondary locking mechanisms

    STEP 3: NEGATION HANDLING
    - Check for explicit denials:
      ✓ \"No pull-to-seat required\"
      ✓ \"Self-retaining terminals\"
      ✓ \"Zero-stroke insertion\"
    - Verify no contradictory claims

    STEP 4: ASSEMBLY CONTEXT CONFIRMATION
    - Required pull action must be:
      ✓ Final assembly step
      ✓ Necessary for terminal retention
      ✓ Performed by installer (not tool)
    - If tool-assisted pull: Treat as \"No\"

    STEP 5: FINAL VERIFICATION
    - Meets ALL criteria:
      1. Explicit pull action requirement ✓
      2. Assembly-phase context ✓
      3. No alternative retention methods ✓
    - Any ambiguity → Default to \"No\"

GENDER_PROMPT = """
Determine connector gender using this reasoning chain:

STEP 1: TERMINAL TYPE IDENTIFICATION (Internal Contacts)

    Scan the document for information about the electrical contacts within the housing:
    ✓ Explicit gender terms for contacts: "male pin", "female socket", etc.
    ✓ Physical descriptions of contacts:
    * "Pin contacts", "Tab contacts", "Blade contacts" → Functionally Male Contacts
    * "Socket contacts", "Receptacle contacts" → Functionally Female Contacts
    ✓ Specific terminal part numbers mentioned (requires knowledge base about those terminals, if available).

    Note the functional gender(s) of the internal contacts identified.

STEP 2: CAVITY ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS (Housing Structure)

    Analyze the housing design based on descriptions or drawings:
    ✓ Number of positions/cavities.
    ✓ If multiple positions, are they intended for the same type of contact (uniform) or different types (mixed)?
    ✓ Explicit mentions of cavity types: "pin cavities", "socket cavities".

    For potential mixed-gender contacts (identified in Step 1):
    ✓ Check cavity configuration:
    * "Same cavity accepts both pin and socket" → Indicates potential Unisex architecture.
    * "Separate, dedicated cavities for pins and sockets" → Indicates Hybrid architecture.

STEP 3: MANUFACTURER NOMENCLATURE (Assembly Identification)

    Interpret the primary name or terminology used by the manufacturer for the overall assembly:

        "Plug", "Header" → Strong indicator of MALE assembly gender.

        "Receptacle", "Socket", "Connector Housing" (if context implies mating to a plug/header) → Strong indicator of FEMALE assembly gender.

        "Combo", "Hybrid Connector" → Likely Hybrid assembly gender.

    Note any gender-specific suffixes in the main assembly part number (less common, e.g., "-M", "-F").

STEP 4: CONFLICT RESOLUTION & GENDER DETERMINATION

    Priority Rule: The Manufacturer Nomenclature (Step 3) for the overall assembly ("Plug" or "Receptacle") is the primary determinant of the final assembly gender classification (Male/Female). This overrides the functional gender of the internal contacts (Step 1) if they conflict.

        Example: A housing named "Plug" (Male indicator) containing internal socket contacts (Female function) is classified as MALE overall.

        Example: A housing named "Receptacle" (Female indicator) containing internal pin contacts (Male function) is classified as FEMALE overall.

    Secondary Checks (apply if Step 3 is ambiguous or indicates Hybrid/Unisex):

        Explicit Gender Declarations: If the document explicitly states "Male connector", "Female connector", "Hybrid", "Unisex", use that declaration, overriding Step 3 if necessary (rare).

        Cavity Configuration Evidence (Step 2): Use this to confirm Hybrid (separate mixed cavities) or Unisex (shared mixed cavities) only if Step 3 indicated such potential or was unclear.

        Internal Contact Types (Step 1): Mainly used to confirm uniformity (all pins or all sockets) or mixed nature for Hybrid/Unisex analysis.

    Final Decision Logic:

        If Step 3 clearly indicates "Plug" (Male) or "Receptacle" (Female) → Assign that gender.

        If Step 3 indicates Hybrid/Combo → Assign Hybrid.

        If Step 2 confirms Unisex architecture → Assign Unisex.

        If unambiguous determination isn't possible following these rules → Assign NOT FOUND.

    Reject unverified assumptions.

STEP 5: FINAL VALIDATION

    Confirm the SINGLE final classification based on the resolution in Step 4:
    ✓ Male: Typically a "Plug" assembly.
    ✓ Female: Typically a "Receptacle" assembly.
    ✓ Hybrid: Contains separate cavities for both Male and Female functional contacts.
    ✓ Unisex: Contains cavities designed to accept both Male and Female functional contacts.

    Ensure the reasoning aligns with the priority rules.

**Examples:**
- **\"Part Name: Receptacle Assembly. Drawing shows pin contacts in all positions.\"**
  → REASONING: [Step1] Pin contacts (Male function) → [Step3] "Receptacle" = Female assembly → [Step4] Priority Rule applied: Manufacturer Nomenclature 'Receptacle' determines Female assembly gender, overriding internal contact type → [Step5] Uniform Female assembly.
  → GENDER: **female**
- **\"Part Name: Plug Assembly. Document specifies applicable socket terminals.\"**
  → REASONING: [Step1] Socket terminals (Female function) → [Step3] "Plug" = Male assembly → [Step4] Priority Rule applied: Manufacturer Nomenclature 'Plug' determines Male assembly gender, overriding internal contact type → [Step5] Uniform Male assembly.
  → GENDER: **male**
- **\"Combo Connector: Cavities A1-A5 accept pins, B1-B5 accept sockets.\"**
  → REASONING: [Step1] Both Pin & Socket contacts → [Step2] Separate cavities → [Step3] "Combo" = Likely Hybrid → [Step4] Cavity evidence confirms Hybrid → [Step5] Hybrid assembly.
  → GENDER: **Hybrid**

Determine connector color using this reasoning chain:

    STEP 1: PART TYPE CLASSIFICATION
    - Identify from:
      ✓ \"Assembled\"/\"Multi-component\" → Assembly
      ✓ \"Housing\"/\"Single-piece\" → Connector body
      ✓ Component lists with separate colors

    STEP 2: COLOR SOURCE SELECTION
    - For ASSEMBLIES:
      > Analyze all components (housing, latches, seals)
      > Ignore non-structural elements (labels, markings)
    - For SINGLE-PIECE:
      > Focus on housing material description
      > Ignore contact/terminal colors

    STEP 3: DOMINANCE ANALYSIS
    - Evaluate color references:
      ✓ Quantitative: \"70% black cover\"
      ✓ Qualitative: \"primary color\", \"main housing\"
      ✓ Visual hierarchy: \"red base with blue accents\"
    - Multi-color triggers:
      * \"Striped\"/\"checkered\" patterns
      * Equal distribution (\"50-50 split\")
      * Explicit \"multi-color\" statement

    STEP 4: CONTEXT VALIDATION
    - Reject ambiguous terms:
      ✗ \"Natural\" (unless defined by a specific color code like '101 nt')
      ✗ Material-inferred colors (brass=golden)
    - Accept only explicitly stated colors or codes:
      ✓ \"Black housing\", "Colour: 000 bk"
      ✓ \"Blue CPA latch\"

    STEP 5: FINAL RESOLUTION
    - Apply priority:
      1. Explicit dominant color
      2. Assembly majority
      3. Multi-color indicators
      4. NOT FOUND

    **Examples:**
    - **\"Black nylon housing with nickel-plated contacts\"**
      → REASONING: [Step1] Single-piece → [Step2] Housing color → [Step4] Explicit
      → COLOUR: **000 bk**
    - **"Connector color is natural (code 101 nt)."**
      → REASONING: [Step4] Explicitly defined natural color
      → COLOUR: **101 nt**
    - **"The part is yellow, specified as 111 ye."**
      → REASONING: [Step4] Explicit color name and code
      → COLOUR: **111 ye**
    - **"The connector body is grey (color code 777 gy)."**
      → REASONING: [Step1] Single-piece → [Step4] Explicit color name and code
      → COLOUR: **777 gy**
    - **\"Assembly: White cover (60%), grey base (40%)\"**
      → REASONING: [Step1] Assembly → [Step3] White dominant → [Step5] Majority
      → COLOUR: **999 wh**
    - **\"Red/blue dual-tone design\"**
      → REASONING: [Step1] Single-piece → [Step3] Equal prominence → [Step5] Multi
      → COLOUR: **multi**

COLOUR_CODING_PROMPT = """

You MUST follow these five steps, in order, using ONLY the PDF context.  Do NOT shortcut or omit any step.

STEP 1: MECHANICAL CODING PREREQUISITE  
• From the context, confirm there is mechanical coding (Coding A/B/C/D/Z, physical keying, CPA/TPA).  
• If NONE is present, stop and return “None”.

STEP 2: COMPONENT FOCUS IDENTIFICATION  
• Identify the coding components (CPA latches, TPA inserts, coding keys, mechanical polarization features).  
• Ignore all other parts (housing, seals unless explicitly color-coded).

STEP 3: COLOR DIFFERENTIATION CHECK  
• If you see “COLOR: SEE TABLE,” ALWAYS locate and parse the following table before proceeding.  
• Compare each coding component’s color (from snippet or parsed table) to the base housing color.  
  – If ALL coding components match the housing → return “None”.  
  – If ≥1 differs, proceed.  
• Ensure the text indicates the purpose is “color-coded for variant identification” or equivalent.

STEP 4: DOMINANT COLOR SELECTION (in priority order)  
1. Any explicit “X denotes variant Y” statements.  
2. The color used by the MAJORITY of coding components.  
3. The color with the HIGHEST visual contrast vs. housing.  
4. The FIRST mentioned color.

STEP 5: DOCUMENT CONSISTENCY VERIFICATION  
• Confirm all of: same drawing/family context; multiple variants present; color-coding purpose clearly stated.  
• If any check fails, return “None”.

OUTPUT FORMAT  
• Respond with exactly one JSON object:  
  `{ "{attribute_key}": "extracted_value" }`  
• `extracted_value` must be either a valid color name (e.g. “Red”, “Blue”, “Orange”) or “None”.  
• Do NOT include any other keys, text, or explanation.

FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES  
1) Context: “Type A (Red CPA) vs Type B (Blue CPA)” → `{ "{attribute_key}": "Blue" }` or `{ "{attribute_key}": "Red" }`  
2) Context: “Coding key is Orange.” → `{ "{attribute_key}": "Orange" }`  
3) Context: “Black housing with black CPA/TTA.” → `{ "{attribute_key}": "None" }`

    STEP 2: MAX TEMPERATURE RESOLUTION
    - Collect all max candidates:
      > Explicit numbers
      > Standard-derived values (e.g., UL RTI 130°C → 130)
    - Apply hierarchy:
      1. Explicit stated maximums
      2. Range upper bounds (\"X°C to Y°C\" → Y)
      3. Standard implications
    - No data? → 999

    STEP 3: MIN TEMPERATURE RESOLUTION
    - Collect min candidates:
      > Explicit numbers
      > Standard implications:
        * Automotive → -40°C
        * Industrial → -20°C

    STEP 5: FINAL VALIDATION
    - Both values = 999? → NOT FOUND
    - Any value ≠999? → Final output

    **Examples:**

HOUSING_SEAL_PROMPT = """
Determine housing seal type using this reasoning chain:

STEP 1: TERM SCAN (case-insensitive)
- Search for matches of:
  ✓ "Radial Seal"
  ✓ "Interface Seal"
- Reject:
  ✗ Plural/gerund forms ("Seals", "Sealing")
  ✗ Combined terms ("Radial/Interface", "Radial or Interface")

STEP 2: SEAL CONTEXT VALIDATION
- Confirm matches refer specifically to:
  ✓ Connector-to-counterpart interface
  ✓ Environmental sealing function
  ✗ Internal terminal seals
  ✗ Secondary locking features

STEP 3: EXCLUSIVE MATCH RESOLUTION
- If multiple matches:
  ✓ Prioritize document hierarchy:
    • "Primary: Radial Seal" → Select Radial
    • "Standard: Interface Seal" → Select Interface
  ✗ Reject ambiguous combinations:
    • "Available with Radial Seal or Interface Seal"

STEP 4: RING SEAL INTERPRETATION
- If "Ring Seal" is found (any case), and:
  ✓ It refers to a connector-to-counterpart sealing function
  → Map it to Radial Seal
- Reasoning:
  • Ring Seals typically function through radial compression
  • Matches Radial Seal's mechanical behavior
- Reject if:
  ✗ Term does not describe housing or counterpart sealing
  ✗ Mention is unrelated (e.g., O-rings in internal terminals)

STEP 5: FINAL VALIDATION
- Strict requirements:
  1. Term match or valid Ring Seal mapping
  2. Valid context
  3. Single validated occurrence
  4. Housing-specific reference

**Examples:**
- **"Housing-to-counterpart seal: radial seal"**
  → REASONING: [Step1] Match → [Step2] Context → Valid
  → HOUSING SEAL: **radial seal**
- **"The datasheet specifies an interface seal for mating."**
  → REASONING: [Step1] Match 'interface seal' → [Step2] Context is mating → Valid
  → HOUSING SEAL: **interface seal**
- **"This is an unsealed indoor connector with no housing seal."**
  → REASONING: [Step1] Explicit denial → Valid
  → HOUSING SEAL: **none**
- **"Connector uses a molded ring seal to prevent ingress"**
  → REASONING: [Step4] Ring Seal Detected → [Step2] Context → Valid Mapping
  → HOUSING SEAL: **radial seal**

**Output format:**

SET_KIT_PROMPT = """
Determine the **Set/Kit** status using this reasoning chain:

    STEP 1: LEONI PART NUMBER ANALYSIS
    - Extract all LEONI part numbers (e.g., \"L-1234\", \"LEO-5A6B\")
    - If **only one part number** exists:
      ✓ Check if it includes accessories (cover, lever, TPA)
      ✓ Verify accessories lack individual part numbers
    - If **multiple part numbers**:
      ✗ Confirm if they belong to separate components

    STEP 2: ACCESSORY IDENTIFICATION
    - List all included components:
      ✓ \"Cover\", \"lever\", \"TPA\", etc.
    - Validate if accessories are:
      ✓ Documented under the **same part number** → **Yes**
      ✓ Assigned **separate part numbers** → **No**

    STEP 3: PREASSEMBLY CHECK
    - Confirm accessories are **NOT preassembled**:
      ✓ Terms like \"loose pieces\", \"requires assembly\"
      ✗ \"Preinstalled cover\" or \"built-in lever\"

    STEP 4: EXPLICIT STATEMENT PRIORITIZATION
    - Override inferences if:
      ✓ \"Set/Kit\" explicitly stated → **Yes**
      ✓ \"Separate part numbers required\" → **No**

    STEP 5: DEFAULT RESOLUTION
    - Ambiguous part numbers or missing info → **NOT FOUND**

    **Examples:**
    - **\"Connector Set (P/N L-789) includes cover and lever as loose pieces.\""**

HV_QUALIFIED_PROMPT = """
Determine HV qualification using this reasoning chain:

    STEP 1: VOLTAGE ANALYSIS
    - Extract all voltage references:
      ✓ Explicit ranges (\"48-800V\")
      ✓ Nominal values (\"400V system\")
      ✓ Standards (\"IEC 60664-1 Class B\")
    - Immediate disqualifiers:
      ≤60V → Auto \"No\"
      Exactly 60V → \"No\"

    STEP 2: EXPLICIT HV MARKERS
    - Scan for exact terms:
      ✓ \"HV-qualified\"/\"HV-certified\"
      ✓ \"HV-connector\"/\"HV-assembly\"
      ✓ \"High-voltage system/application\"
    - Reject:
      ✗ \"High vibration\"
      ✗ \"High velocity\"

    STEP 3: DOCUMENT HIERARCHY
    - For conflicting claims:
      ✓ Prioritize by:
        1. Certification documents
        2. Technical specifications
        3. Marketing materials
      ✓ Use document dates:
        \"2025 spec overrides 2023\"

    STEP 4: CONTEXTUAL VALIDATION
    - Confirm HV context:
      ✓ Electric vehicles
      ✓ Battery systems >60V
      ✓ Charging infrastructure
    - Reject non-electrical \"HV\":
      ✗ Hydraulic systems
      ✗ HVAC (non-battery)

    STEP 5: FINAL RESOLUTION
    - For a "Yes" classification, one of these must be true:
      1. Explicitly stated as "HV-qualified" or similar term.
      2. Used in an application with voltage > 60V AND designed for that purpose (e.g., orange color, specific HV safety features mentioned).
    - Otherwise, classify as "No".

    **Examples:**
    - **"A 12V standard connector for lighting."**
      → REASONING: [Step1] Voltage ≤60V → Auto "No"
      → HV QUALIFIED: **No**
    - **\"HV-qualified per LV215-1\"**
      → REASONING: [Step2] Explicit term → [Step5] Valid → Yes
      → HV QUALIFIED: **Yes**
    - **"Orange 800V battery connector compliant with IEC 62196."**
      → REASONING: [Step1] >60V → [Step4] Valid HV context → Yes
      → HV QUALIFIED: **Yes**
    - **\"60V hybrid system with HV markings\"**
      → REASONING: [Step1] 60V → Auto reject
      → HV QUALIFIED: **No**

    **Output format:**
    HV QUALIFIED: [Yes/No]
